    <h1> Kata: Merge two sorted arrays into one</h1>
    <p>
        You don't need to worry about validation, since arr1 and arr2 must be arrays with 0 or more <br>
        Integers. If both arr1 and arr2 are empty, then just return an empty array.<br>
        <br>
        Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same <br>
        integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.<br>
        <br>
        Examples (input -> output)<br>
        <br>
        * [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br>
        <br>
        * [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br>
        <br>
        * [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12]<br>
